Direct Supply's 'Option 1: Quiz' Kata -> by Sophia Heuss
In this file, I will keep track of my thought process and steps I take to make this app.

Steps:
 1. Generally think about the steps I need to take for building a quiz app
 2. Make an index.html file that holds the simple outline of the web app
 3. Brainstorm the layout of the website (and pages)
 4. Make some theme options for user to choose from
 5. Create a divider to hold each question and answer pairs -> double loop
 6. Keep the user updated on if they are getting questions correct (score)
 7. Allow users to take the quiz again or go back to home to pick a different theme
 8. Present final score and feedback after finishing quiz

Notes:
- Currently learning javascript in a class right now, so I knew that fetching might be hard, but Youtube is usually my go to for concepts I understand loosely
- I started with a list (html element), but I knew I wanted to make it into buttons later on -> I ended up making buttons
- Found myself stuck on branching to a new page and using a specific API -> asked chatgpt to explain how to do this in javascript
- Needed to look at my old projects for basic starter html setup 
- I love to step by step comment my code -> this helps me!
- I knew I wanted the answer choices shuffled, but needed to research how
- API was giving weird looking answers, so I asked chatgpt how to format it to look like plain text
- When I clicked a quiz, went home, then went back to the page nothing came up. I didn't understand why, so I put it into chatgpt to explain.
    - Chatgpt said it had something to do with browser caching.

Resources Used:
- Chatgpt -> to understand how to branch off into a new page using a specific API after a specific button was pressed
- Chatgpt -> syntax for filling the content inside the h3 element tags
- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/how-to-shuffle-an-array-using-javascript/
    - The above link was used for the Fisher-Yates shuffle (shuffling the answers)
- Chatgpt -> how to write a helper method to decode the weird looking HTML answers given by the API
- CS571 class notes/slideshow -> syntax/styling
- Chatgpt -> for auto scrolling when elements get added and when quiz is done
